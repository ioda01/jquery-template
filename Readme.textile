h1. jQuery Template

<p>
The jQuery-template plugin is a simple jQuery plugin that can be used in doing client side templateing(as I like to call it.).
</p>

h2. What does it do

<p>
	The jQuery-template plugin is simple to use and to describe what it does I better show you.
So if I have the following string:
<code>var string = "This is from {source} and author {author}"</code>
Call the template method
<code>$('span').template({'source' : 'The insider', 'author' : 'Juno'})</code>
The above code will replace the placeholders {source} and {author} with the values from the keys with the same name from the given object and the result
will be:
<code><span>This is from The insider and author Juno</span></code>
</p>
<p>
	It is as simple as that. Its is not much but it is a really nice plugin and it helped me when handling small jsons and displaying in a readble mode
	for example in a tooltip.
</p>

	For more examples check the test-template.js.
